                <p>Hi! My name is Benjamin Olsen, a full time teacher and native of snowy Wisconsin. In my spare time I
                    enjoy
                    wrestling bears, watching the Packers face the bears, and drinking bear I mean "beer." I graduated
                    with
                    an
                    education and Spanish degree in 2017, and have been teaching high school Spanish ever since. I most
                    recently
                    moved to Washington this past June and have enjoyed my time here, even through the rainy weather. My
                    friends and
                    I have had opportunities to explore Mt. Rainier, downtown Seattle, and the surrounding area night
                    life.
                    There is
                    a lot more to see, mainly restaurants, that I want to see and am excited to make this new place my
                    home.
                </p>
                <p2> I do not have past experience coding but do have many friends and colleagues who have gotten into
                    the
                    profession. One close friend even took a similar boot camp and is now coding a website with his
                    father.
                    My hope
                    is that this class will be able to open new career paths and strengthen my skills as a learner and
                    professional.
