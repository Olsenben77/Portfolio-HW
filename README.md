## Portfolio

This portfolio project is a set of three webpages, dedicated to showing introductory HTML and CSS programming abilities. The first page, Index, gives some background information on me and a portfolio picture. The second page, Contact, allows the user to input personal information including a short message. The final page, Portfolio, is a collection of pictures and textboxes.

## Motivation
I created this portfolio project as 1st homework assignment in Coding Boot Camp, but also to serve as a stepping stone to bigger and more complex activities.

## Features
This project features beginner-level HTML and CSS as well as some personal information about inclduing a short biography and pictures.
